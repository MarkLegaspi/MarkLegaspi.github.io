        <p>My name is Mark Anthony Albina Legaspi. I am 18 years old. I live in Olongapo City, Philippines. I was born on January 6, 2000. I am the oldest in family and I have 2 brothers. </p>
        <p>I am very shy and introverted person. I feel really really shy when I am around with many people. But I want to overcome it and I think it's still possible to change. I don't really talk to everyone that i didn't know, i want to become a friendly person.
        <p>I am going to college in August and my course is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am really excited because I will learn more about programming and things about IT industry. I hope i will be good in school.

        <h2 id="dreams-in-life">My Dreams in Life</h2>
        <h6>July 10, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>I have a lot of dreams in life. One of my dreams in life is of course to become a Programmer, Web Developer, Animator, Software Engineer, and etc. I don't really expect that I am having this dreams because when I was a kid a dream of becoming a doctor not a programmer or so whatever. And now I am 18 and become familliar in technologies, I'm in love with it. I guess this is really I am supposed to be, to become a programmer.</p>
        <p>We all know that studying programming is not that easy. You need to have a logical, critical, and analytical thinking. You need to study by yourself because technology is growing and growing time by time. I tell myself that I will become optimistic in studying programming.
        <p>My school is very close because it's already July and my first day of school is on August 6. I am really happy because now I know a little bit about HTML and CSS. I promise myself to focus on studies and avoid distractions like having a relationship or going out with gang. I will just study and study until one day I am capable of becoming Programmer, Web Developer, Animator, Software Engineer. Time flies so fast and I should enjoy my life too but I will enjoy soon, my priority for now is studying. I hope i become successful in life.
